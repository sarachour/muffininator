<h3>Muffin Monday Message</h3><br>
Happy muffin monday everyone!<br>
Sorry about the lazy puzzle this week - I have a deadline :(. Muffins are once again, in the 9th floor lounge in Gates at 5pm. Come by, socialize, and be merry (generally). Or if you aren't merry or social, join in for food sustenance.
