<h3>Muffin Monday Message</h3><br><br>
Happy Muffin Monday Everyone!<br>
I'll cut to the chase - Muffin Monday. G9. 5pm - attend, eat, enjoy. I thought a short message would be nice for a change. To commemorate the completion of the world cup (congrats Germany!), I included some relevant gifs.

PS:<br>
Did you know the amount of force used to bite into a carrot is the same amount of force to bite your pinkie off?<br><br>

PS: Here's the puzzle solution:<br>
Cut a circular hole out of the center of the table, the same size of that in the corner. Insert circle inside the old hole. We've thus accomplished the desired task in 1 cut.
