<h3>Muffin Monday Message</h3><br><br>
Happy Muffin Monday Everyone!<br><br>
I don't have anything witty to say today. I'm not implying that i'm usually witty - just stating a fact. Anyway, There will be sugar and carbs in the G9 lounge today at 5pm. There also may be people, so come by early and get in line if you want the coveted apple turnover. If you like neither sugar nor carbs, come by to talk to your fellow colleagues. Or don't. 
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Sara<br><br>
PS: Did you know the founder of Scientology once fought a 68 hour naval battle with two non-existent Japanese submarines after operating his vesselâ€™s SONAR incorrectly?<br><br>
