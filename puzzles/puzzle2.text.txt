<h3>Muffin Monday Message</h3><br>
Happy muffin monday everyone!<br>
I'm finally back from space/mordor/oregon and ready for yet another nonmuffiny muffin monday. Muffins are once again, in the 9th floor lounge in Gates at 5pm. Come by, socialize, and be merry (generally). Or if you aren't merry or social, join in for food sustenance. 
<br>
PS:All future puzzles are standardized. They are now linked through the web interface :D. Also, now you can give up

Caio!<br>
